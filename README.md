I developed a deep learning model in PyTorch to predict studentsâ€™ final grades (G3) based on demographic, social, and academic features, achieving improved accuracy over baseline models. The project included building an end-to-end pipeline with preprocessing, model training, SHAP-based explainability, and deployment of a Flask web app featuring a simple UI for real-time predictions.
